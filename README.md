# Air-prediction-
Air quality prediction involves estimating pollutant levels using historical data and environmental factors through various data-driven techniques. The process begins with collecting historical air quality and meteorological data, followed by preprocessing to clean and normalize the dataset. Machine learning models, such as linear regression, random forests, or neural networks, are then trained on this data to capture complex relationships between variables. Model performance is evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared, with results visualized for better understanding. Once validated, the model can be deployed for real-time predictions, aiding public health initiatives, policy-making, and environmental research by providing insights into air quality trends and risks.
